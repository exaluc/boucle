Git, the free and open-source distributed version control system, is at the heart of countless software projects — both large and small. Its functionality and flexibility allow developers to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and manage complex projects with ease. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of Git, from basic commands that every beginner should know to advanced features that can boost the productivity of even seasoned experts.

## Getting Started

First things first, you need to install Git. Most Linux distributions include Git in their standard repositories. To install Git on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

For Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL:

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

## Basic Git Commands

Every journey starts with the first step. Here are some of the most common commands you need to get started with Git.

### 1. git init

This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

```bash
git init
```

### 2. git clone

To work with a repository that already exists, you can clone it to your local machine. Replace `URL` with the URL of the remote repository.

```bash
git clone URL
```

### 3. git add

This command adds files from your working directory to your staging area.

```bash
git add filename    # adds a specific file
git add .           # adds all files in the current directory
```

### 4. git commit

To save your changes, you need to commit them. This command saves your changes to the local repository.

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### 5. git push

The `git push` command sends your committed changes to a remote repository.

```bash
git push origin master    # pushes changes to the master branch of the remote repository named "origin"
```

### 6. git pull

The `git pull` command fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

```bash
git pull origin master    # pulls changes from the master branch of the remote repository named "origin"
```

## Intermediate Git Commands

Once you've mastered the basics, you can use these intermediate commands to manage your repositories more effectively.

### 1. git branch

This command lists all the branches in your repository, and highlights the one you're currently on.

```bash
git branch
```

You can also create a new branch using the same command.

```bash
git branch new-branch-name
```

### 2. git checkout

The `git checkout` command allows you to switch between different branches and files in your Git repository.

```bash
git checkout branch-name    # switch to an existing branch
```

You can create a new branch and switch to it using the `-b` option.

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

### 3. git merge

To combine the changes made in one branch with another, use the `git merge` command.

```bash
git merge branch-name
```

### 4. git diff

This command displays conflicts between branches. Before a merge, you can preview the changes that will be made.

```bash
git diff source-branch target-branch
```

### 5. git stash

You can use the `git stash` command to temporarily save changes that you don't want to commit immediately.

```bash
git stash
```

You can apply the stashed changes later using `git stash apply`.

```bash
git stash apply
```

## Advanced Git Commands

For those well-versed in the basics of Git, here are some advanced commands to boost your productivity.

### 1. git rebase

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It's an alternative to merge.

```bash
git rebase branch-name
```

### 2. git bisect

Bisect helps in finding the commit that introduced a bug by using binary search.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
git bisect good version-number # This is the last 'good' commit
```

### 3. git cherry-pick

This command applies the changes introduced by some existing commits.

```bash
git cherry-pick commit-hash
```

### 4. git reflog

Reflog stands for reference logs. This command will show you when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.

```bash
git reflog
```

### 5. git revert

This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit.

```bash
git revert commit-hash
```

Mastering Git is a journey of continuous learning and exploration. The commands discussed in this guide form the foundation of this journey. As you gain proficiency, you'll realize that Git is more than just a version control system—it's a powerful tool to streamline your software development process. Keep experimenting, keep exploring, and let Git and its myriad features guide you on your path to becoming a Git Guru.
